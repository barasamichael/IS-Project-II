SettleBot: ## DIRECT ANSWER
Yes, many landlords in Nairobi require a local guarantor, especially for
international students. This is to ensure that there is someone local who
can be held accountable for the lease. However, some landlords may be
flexible, especially if you can provide proof of your financial stability,
such as bank statements or a scholarship letter.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
In Nairobi, the rental market can be competitive, and having a local
guarantor can significantly ease the process. If you don’t have a local
contact, consider reaching out to your university’s international office;
they often have resources or networks to help students find housing.
Additionally, be cautious of rental scams and always view the property
before making any payments. Rent prices vary widely depending on the
neighborhood, with areas like Westlands and Kilimani being popular among
students, typically ranging from KSh 25,000 to KSh 60,000 for shared
accommodations.

## NEXT STEPS
1. Contact your university's international student office for assistance in
finding a local guarantor or housing options.
2. Use reputable property websites like Buy Rent Kenya to search for
listings and communicate directly with landlords.
3. Schedule viewings for any properties you’re interested in and ensure you
have all necessary documents ready, such as proof of income or bank
statements.

student groups on social media platforms where you can connect with other
students who might help.

Before signing a rental agreement in Nairobi, ensure you check the

amount and any additional fees. It's crucial to see the property in person,

accessible. Always read the contract carefully and clarify any unclear terms
before committing.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
When looking for housing, prioritize neighborhoods known for being
student-friendly, like Westlands, Parklands, or Karen, which offer good
transport links and amenities. Be wary of rental scams; avoid agents who ask
for upfront fees without showing you the property first. Typical rent for a
one-bedroom apartment in these areas can range from KSh 25,000 to KSh
60,000, depending on the location and amenities. Always check for hidden
costs like maintenance fees and utility bills.

need a certified copy of your passport or alien card, an introductory letter
from your employer (if applicable), and a recent pay slip or proof of funds.
Additionally, you may need a passport-sized photo and a small initial
deposit, depending on the bank's requirements.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

balance or monthly fees. Ensure you have all necessary documents ready to
avoid delays, especially if you plan to send or receive money
internationally.

SettleBot: ## DIRECT ANSWER
M-Pesa is a mobile money service in Kenya that allows you to send and
receive money, pay for goods and services, and top-up airtime directly from
your phone. To use M-Pesa, you first need to register with Safaricom by
visiting an authorized agent or M-Pesa store, where you can deposit money
into your account. Transactions are secure and require a personal
identification number (PIN) for protection.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
M-Pesa is widely accepted across Kenya, making it an essential tool for both
locals and international students. You can use it to pay for meals,
transport, and even tuition fees without needing a bank account. The service
is particularly useful because only about 8% of Kenyans have bank accounts,
so cash transactions are common. Setting up an M-Pesa account is
straightforward, and you can find agents in urban areas, shopping malls, and
markets.

## NEXT STEPS
1. Locate a Safaricom agent or M-Pesa store near you; you can use Google
Maps or ask locals for directions.
2. Bring your identification (like a passport) and some cash to deposit into
your M-Pesa account.

for easy transactions.

international transfers. The fees for M-Pesa transactions vary depending on
the amount sent, but they are generally lower than traditional banks. For
Western Union, you can visit their agents in Nairobi, which are often found
in supermarkets or dedicated outlets. Always ensure you verify the
recipient's details to avoid scams, especially when sending money

SettleBot: ## DIRECT ANSWER
Public transport in Nairobi primarily consists of matatus (shared minibuses)
and buses. Matatus are colorful and affordable, with fares ranging from
20-100 KSh per trip, but they can be crowded and chaotic. Buses, operated by
Kenya Bus Services and others, are another option, costing around 20-30 KSh.
For a more comfortable ride, you can use ride-hailing services like Uber,
which typically charge between 200-500 KSh for short distances.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Matatus cover extensive routes throughout Nairobi, making them a popular
choice for students on a budget. However, they can be unpredictable in terms
of safety and comfort, so it's essential to stay alert and keep your
belongings secure. Buses are generally more reliable but may have limited
routes compared to matatus. Uber is a safer option, especially at night,
though it can be pricier. Always plan your route ahead of time and avoid
traveling during rush hours (7-9 am and 4-6 pm) to minimize delays.

## NEXT STEPS
1. Download the Uber app for convenient ride-hailing and to check fares
before you travel.
2. Familiarize yourself with the matatu routes by asking local students or
using online resources.
3. Consider joining local student groups on social media to get tips on safe
travel routes and experiences.
4. Always keep some cash (KSh) on hand for matatu and bus fares, as not all
drivers accept mobile payments.

Using matatus at night is generally not recommended due to safety concerns.
They can be overcrowded and chaotic, and the risk of theft or other
incidents increases after dark. It's safer to use registered taxis or
ride-sharing services like Uber for nighttime travel in Nairobi.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Matatus are a popular and affordable way to get around during the day, but
they can be unpredictable and may not have safety features like seatbelts.
At night, the risk of crime increases, and matatus may not be as reliable.
If you must travel at night, consider using a reputable taxi service or a
ride-sharing app, which can provide a safer and more comfortable experience.
Always keep your belongings close and avoid displaying valuables.

## NEXT STEPS
1. Download the Uber app or similar ride-sharing services like Bolt for
safer nighttime transportation.
2. Familiarize yourself with local taxi companies by asking fellow students
or checking online reviews.
3. Save local emergency numbers on your phone, including police (999) and
ambulance services (999 or 0709 123 456).

depending on how often you travel and the modes of transport you choose. If
you primarily use matatus and buses, you can keep costs lower, while using
taxis or ride-hailing services like Uber will increase your expenses.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Nairobi has a variety of transportation options, including matatus
(minibuses), buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. Matatus and buses are
the most budget-friendly, costing between 20-100 KSh per trip, while Uber
rides can range from 200-500 KSh for short distances. If you plan to travel
frequently, consider getting a monthly pass for buses or matatus if
available, which can save you money. Always be cautious of your belongings,

To get from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to the city center,
you have several options. The most convenient is to use a ride-hailing
service like Uber or Bolt, which are safe and affordable, typically costing
around KSh 1,500 to KSh 2,500 depending on traffic. Alternatively, you can

may not be the safest choice for newcomers. If you choose a taxi, ensure
it's a licensed operator, and be cautious about your belongings during the
ride.

## NEXT STEPS
1. Download a ride-hailing app like Uber or Bolt before your arrival to make
your trip smoother.

Nairobi, unaweza kupata chaguzi za chakula halal, kosher, na mboga katika
mikahawa mbalimbali na maeneo ya chakula ya ndani. Kwa chakula halal, maeneo
kama Al-Yusra na Hashmi's ni maarufu, wakati chaguzi za mboga zinaweza
kupatikana katika mikahawa kama The Veggie House na Urban Eatery. Aidha,
masoko ya ndani kama City Market mara nyingi yana chakula cha mitaani cha
mboga kama bhajias na samosas.

## TAARIFA ZA ZIADA
Scene ya chakula ya Nairobi ni tofauti, ikihudumia mahitaji mbalimbali ya
lishe. Chakula halal kinapatikana kwa wingi kutokana na idadi kubwa ya
Waislamu, na mikahawa mingi inaweka wazi lebo za bidhaa zao. Kwa chaguzi za
kosher, unaweza kuhitaji kuangalia mikahawa maalum au maduka makubwa
yanayohudumia sheria za lishe za Kiyahudi, kwani hizi zinaweza kuwa nadra.
Wanafunzi wa mboga watafurahia wingi wa mazao mapya na vyakula vya ndani
kama ugali (uji wa mahindi) na sukuma wiki (kabeji za kijani). Chakula cha
mitaani pia ni njia ya gharama nafuu ya kuchunguza ladha za ndani, ambapo
milo kwa kawaida inagharimu kati ya 150-300 KSh.

## HATUA ZIFUATIE
1. Tembelea mikahawa kama Al-Yusra (iliyoko Parklands) kwa chaguzi za halal
au The Veggie House katika Westlands kwa milo ya mboga.
2. Chunguza masoko ya ndani kama City Market au Muthurwa kwa chakula cha
mitaani cha mboga chenye bei nafuu.
3. Angalia majukwaa mtandaoni kama TripAdvisor au Google Maps kwa maoni na
chaguzi zaidi za mikahawa zinazofaa mahitaji yako ya lishe.
4. Fikiria kujiunga na vikundi vya wanafunzi wa ndani kwenye mitandao ya
kijamii ili kupata mapendekezo kutoka kwa wenzao kuhusu wapi pa kula
kulingana na mapendeleo yako ya lishe.
